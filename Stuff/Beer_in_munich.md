Reddit Munich Beer list
===

I created this list to have something i can easily copy&paste since people constantly ask about beer in the munich subreddit.  
I left out beer gardens on purpose; there are just too many of them, almost all are decent and none of them offer anything special in terms of beer.

If you are local and want to improve this list by adding or correcting something please just contact me.  
But please keep in mind that this list focuses on places where the beer itself is at the center of attention.

## TOC
 1. Independent Craft Restaurants, Beer Halls and Bars
 2. Traditional Munich Breweries and their Restaurants/Beer Halls
 3. Other places or breweries worth visiting/drinking

## (Bigger or 'real') Munich Breweries and their Restaurants/Beer Halls
_"Münchner Bier"_ is a protected term under [EU PGI law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_indications_and_traditional_specialities_in_the_European_Union), and two of the criterias are that the brewery has to be within the city limits and that they get their water from a deep well within the city limits. The breweries in this list are the only ones fulfilling all criterias.

Giesinger is the outlier here, as it's the youngest and smallest by far. It's not part of the big six and i wouldn't classify it as macro. But it belongs in this list since it is a 'real' Munich brewery with it's own deep well by now. There will soon be another new munich brewery: Münchner Kindl.

Beer from the big six can be had everywhere in town, most restaurants and pubs have exclusive deals with one of them.

* [Augustiner](https://www.augustiner-braeu.de) _(privately/foundation owned)_
  * [Augustiner Bräustuben](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/82772298) is the one next to the brewery. Nice rooftop garden.
  * Basically everywhere, probably 15+ Augustiner locations in town
  * [Museumsstüberl im Bier- und Oktoberfestmuseum](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/656253061) ([Website](https://www.museumsstueberl.com/)) is also owned by the same foundation and worth a visit
* [Hacker-Pschorr](https://www.hacker-pschorr.de) _(owned by the global corporations Schörghuber Group and Heineken)_
  * This brewery doesn't physically exist anymore, just the brand name remains. The beer is brewed at Paulaner.
  * [Hackerhaus](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/700957664)
  * [Der Pschorr](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/358492740)
* [Hofbräu](https://www.hofbraeu-muenchen.de) _(owned by the Free State of Bavaria)_
  * [Hofbräuhaus](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/11829267544) (extremely touristy, but good food and decent beer nonetheless)
* [Giesinger Bräu](https://www.giesinger-braeu.de/) _(privately owned)_
  * [Giesinger Bräustüberl](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3483635411) (Good bavarian food, classical beer styles and more modern "craft" styles.)
  * [Stehausschank Gärtnerplatz](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/98738705)
  * [Stehausschank Viktualienmarkt](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1016358208)
  * [Stehausschank Maxvorstadt](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1813638199)
  * [Stehausschank Universität](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/329088197)
  * [Stehausschank Sendlinger Tor](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/700042712)
  * [Stehausschank Sendling](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2015822730)
  * [Stehausschank Westend](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/337484404)
* [Münchner Kindl](https://www.muenchnerkindlbrauerei.de) _(privately owned)_
  * [Brewery (and Tap Room?)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/1285237072) (**Still under construction, not yet open as of 2025-09**)
  * Founded in 2020 and aiming to be the 8th _real_ munich brewery.
  * The old brewery of the same name was founded in 1880 and was taken over by Unionsbräu in 1905. Unionsbräu then got taken over by Löwenbräu in 1921. Dietrich Sailer, owner of the [Hofbräuhaus Traunstein](https://www.hb-ts.de), acquired the brand rights in 2015.
* [Löwenbräu](https://loewenbraeu.de) _(owned by global corporation AB InBev)_
  * [Löwenbräukeller](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/98064749) should be their main location, never went there though.
* [Paulaner](https://www.paulaner.de) _(owned by the global corporations Schörghuber Group and Heineken)_
  * [Paulaner Bräuhaus](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/307528347)
  * [Paulaner am Nockherberg](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/262128245). This is where the most well known Starkbierfest happens during catholic lent.
* [Spaten/Franziskaner](https://spatenbraeu.de) _(owned by global corporation AB InBev)_
  * [Spatenhaus an der Oper](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/863560075)

## Other places or breweries worth visiting/drinking
* [Bierkiste](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/8467824847) (**will close down on 2025-10-31**)
  * technically a dealer/shop, but they have some seats available. Very nice selection.
* [Kiosk Reichenbachbrücke](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/108574652)
  * As the name suggests it's a Kiosk, but they have an impressive selection of international beers
  * Snack food
  * While technically purely a dealer it's in a perfect spot to start the evening and buy a beer or two for the walk to some of the other locations. The surrounding banks of the river Isar are also really popular in summer, which is why i put it here.
* [Schneider Weisse](https://schneider-weisse.de) (privately owned)
  * Technically not a munich brewery anymore, but great wheat beer.
  * [Weisses Bräuhaus im Tal](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/6013457619) is their main location. Touristy but still good. Great bavarian food, including innards if that's your thing.
  * [Schneider Bräuhaus Berg am Laim](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/281511881)
  * Tip: TAP5 Hopfenweisse
* [Tegernseer](https://www.brauhaus-tegernsee.de) (privately owned)
  * Also not a munich brewery, but their beer is good.
  * [Tegernseer im Tal](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/332790673) just across the street from the Weisses Bräuhaus. Also touristy but pretty good.
* [Airbräu](https://www.munich-airport.de/airbraeu/de)
  * Located at the Airport, so not a munich brewery. But since most people using this list will probably arrive via the Airport i decided to add it.
  * Very fairly priced decent beer and food. They have locations in both Terminals plus a big beer garden in the open area between the terminals (in summer).

## Dealers/Beverage Shops
* [Bierothek](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4851250425) ([Website](https://bierothek.de/stores/muenchen))
  * Operated by the owners of the Munich Brew Mafia brewery, great selection
  * They also offer tastings, seminars and beer-focused games/events
* [Getränke Liebick](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/78282493) ([Website](https://www.landbierzentrale.de)) in Germering
  * Has more or less everything from Frankonia to Belgium to the US, it's amazing.

## Reader's additions
These are additions to the list suggested to me by other locals on reddit. No personal experience yet, so i can't vouch for them.  
These entries might get moved to the list proper or removed once verified.

* [Hopfenhäcker/Forschungsbrauerei](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/253247251) ([Website](http://www.forschungsbrauerei-braeustueberl.de))
